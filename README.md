Virtual Internship - Android Application Development Using Kotlin
I have created a grocery application to include our daily grocery items . It is really helpful as we forget our grocery items a lot of times . We can make our own customized grocery list using this app by following simple steps.  

WORKING : 
Firstly we have press the plus button and there will form popped up asking details of the items like name quantity and cost . After entering the details we will get the list with the details and total cost of the item included . We can repeat the process as many times as we want to make the list . And also there is a delete option for every item which we can use to edit the list .
I've used colors.xml to make my application more aesthetic and also used hint property in form inputs to make them placeholders . 

Learnings:
1. how to take the input from the form and calculate total cost
2. how to store the items in database .
3.  Align the items and also using navigating through pages.

Challenges : 
1. While creating the device in downloading 'S' I have faced challenge .	
2. Faced the challenges during running the emulator resolved it by changing some security options and permissions . 
3.Also my app was running slow some of the times So I have improved Andriod Gradle plugin version and grad le version in file.
4. Faced to run the code due to network issues.
